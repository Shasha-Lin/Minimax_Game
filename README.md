# The Game
The game uses depth-first-search to find the equilibrium for a simple minimax game with binary branches at leaf values initiated uniformly in [-1, 1). The first player, Paul, is the maximizing player, while the second player, Carole, is the minimizing player.

# The Code
**Game_code_and_work_in_progress.ipynb** contains a rough copy of our implementation and analysis of this game, while **Game_analysis.ipynb** is our final write-up, including written responses, plots, and replicable code.

# The Class
This mini project was for Fundamental Algorithms (CSCI-GA/DS-GA 1170) with Professor Joel Spencer at NYU in Spring 2018.

# The People
Shasha Lin and Julie Helmers are both MS in Data Science students at NYU, graduating in May 2018.
